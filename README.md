# qa-microchip-function
Regularized Logistic Regression to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA).
Determine whether the microchips should be accepted or rejected.

# Dataset
During QA, each microchip goes through various tests to ensure it is functioning correctly. And you have the test reesults for some
microchips on two different tests.
To help you make the decision, whethere the microchip passes quality assurance, you have a dataset of test results on past microchips.

This exercise is from [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). This Assignment is originally written in MATLAB, but in this repository I converted it to Python.
